            <h4>About the artist</h4>
            <p>My name is Estera. I come from Croatia, but live in the United Kingdom where I 
                work in a dog rescue centre. Dogs have been my passion since I got my first dog 
                Luna. My other passion is painting. I have been painting since I was a little girl 
                following my father’s steps. Therefore, I made an only possible decision and that 
                is to paint dogs. Mostly I enjoy doing abstract paintings of dogs, but I do very much 
                enjoy making realistic ones as well. Hope you like my paintings as much as I liked making them.</p>

                    <p>Louvre Master Exhibition is one of the most prestige exhibition in the world. On the display, 
                        you will be able to see “The Raft of the Medusa” painted by Théodore Géricault in the 19th century. 
                        This masterpiece depicts the survivors (and the casualties) of the Medusa shipwreck calling for help 
                        when they see in the distance the outline of another ship that could save them. There will also be the 
                        one and only “The Mona Lisa” painted by Leonardo da Vinci in the 19th century. This portrait is assumed 
                        to be of the wife of Francesco del Giocondo. Next in line, you will be able to see “The Wedding at Cana” 
                        painted by Veronese. The painting represent a story of the Old Testament of the Bible.
                        Apart from this less known masterpieces, in this exhibition you will be able to see a well-known “Dog 
                        Portrait” painted by Estera. This is an abstract painting of a dog named Luna. Luna was believed to be 
                        the best dogs in the world. With this painting, Estera managed to achieve something that no other painter 
                        did. She captured the greatness and the shine from Luna.
