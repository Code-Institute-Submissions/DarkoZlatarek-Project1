            <h4>About the artist</h4>
            <p>My name is Estera. I come from Croatia, but live in the United Kingdom where I 
                work in a dog rescue centre. Dogs have been my passion since I got my first dog 
                Luna. My other passion is painting. I have been painting since I was a little girl 
                following my father’s steps. Therefore, I made an only possible decision and that 
                is to paint dogs. Mostly I enjoy doing abstract paintings of dogs, but I do very much 
                enjoy making realistic ones as well. Hope you like my paintings as much as I liked making them.</p>

                        when they see in the distance the outline of another ship that could save them. There will also be the 
                        one and only <em>“The Mona Lisa”</em> painted by Leonardo da Vinci in the 19th century. This portrait is assumed
